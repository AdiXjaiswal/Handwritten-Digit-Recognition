# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A Handwritten Digit Recognition model using MNIST dataset.

## Sequnetial model
- the simplest type of model, allowing you to build a neural network by stacking layers in a linear fashion.
- It is ideal for feedforward networks, convolutional networks (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs) where data flow is unidirectional from input to output.
## Flatten: 
- higher dimension data structure into 1D array.
- We can also give activation function to this, but if this is used for i/p layer then it doesn't require any activation function.
